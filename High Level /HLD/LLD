High-Level Design (HLD)
The High-Level Design provides a broad overview of the system architecture, components, and interactions between them. It’s useful for understanding the major elements and how they work together.

1. Architecture Diagram
Include a diagram that illustrates the main components and their interactions. Here’s an overview you could create in a diagramming tool (like Lucidchart or Draw.io):

Frontend (React.js): Manages the user interface, handles file uploads, and provides an interface for querying documents.
Backend (FastAPI): Acts as the server for handling API requests, managing business logic, and connecting the frontend with the NLP, document storage, and database.
File Storage (AWS S3): Stores uploaded documents, making them accessible to the backend and NLP processing.
NLP Processing (LangChain or LlamaIndex): Performs NLP tasks, particularly for indexing document content and answering user queries.
Database (PostgreSQL & Redis):
PostgreSQL stores structured data, such as user details, document metadata, and logs.
Redis is used for caching to enhance retrieval performance.
Search Engine (Elasticsearch): Provides fast and accurate querying capabilities, especially useful for large document collections.
Orchestration (Docker & Kubernetes): Containerizes and orchestrates services, allowing for easy deployment, scaling, and management.
2. Component Descriptions
Each component has a specific role:

Frontend (React.js):

Purpose: Enables users to upload documents and query them via a user-friendly interface.
Responsibilities: Manages API calls, handles file uploads, and displays responses from the backend.
Backend (FastAPI):

Purpose: The central controller that processes user requests, authenticates users, and coordinates with NLP processing and database storage.
Responsibilities:
User authentication and session management
File handling and metadata storage
Document indexing and querying with the NLP module
API endpoints for document management
File Storage (AWS S3):

Purpose: Store uploaded documents for scalable access and retrieval.
Responsibilities: Persistent storage for files with high availability and durability.
NLP Processing (LangChain or LlamaIndex):

Purpose: Index and interpret document content to allow for context-aware user queries.
Responsibilities: Efficiently retrieve relevant document information and generate accurate answers based on document content.
Database (PostgreSQL & Redis):

Purpose: Maintain structured data and manage caching for optimal performance.
Responsibilities:
PostgreSQL: Persist user and document metadata.
Redis: Provide caching for faster data retrieval.
Search Engine (Elasticsearch):

Purpose: Enhance search capability with high-speed indexing and querying.
Responsibilities: Allow for keyword-based document retrieval.
Orchestration (Docker & Kubernetes):

Purpose: Ensure smooth deployment, scaling, and management of services.
Responsibilities: Containerize services and manage resource allocation.
Low-Level Design (LLD)
The Low-Level Design provides more detailed information about the database schema, specific classes, methods, and interactions.

1. Database Schema Design
Here’s an example of the database schema, including tables and relationships:

Users Table:

Columns: id, username, password_hash, created_at
Purpose: Store user data with secure authentication.
Documents Table:

Columns: id, user_id, title, file_url, content_summary, created_at
Purpose: Store metadata for each document uploaded by a user.
Relationship: Foreign key to Users (one-to-many).
Queries Table:

Columns: id, user_id, document_id, query_text, response_text, timestamp
Purpose: Log user queries and responses for history tracking and potential analytics.
Relationships: Foreign keys to Users and Documents.
2. Class Design
The application may include the following primary classes:

User Class:

Attributes: id, username, password_hash
Methods:
register_user(): Handles new user registration.
authenticate_user(): Verifies user credentials for login.
Document Class:

Attributes: id, user_id, title, file_url, content_summary
Methods:
upload_document(): Manages file upload to S3 and stores metadata.
parse_content(): Extracts document text for NLP processing.
Query Class:

Attributes: id, user_id, document_id, query_text, response_text
Methods:
generate_response(): Calls NLP processing and RAG agent to answer user queries.
log_query(): Stores query and response in the database.
3. Data Flow and Interactions
User Registration and Login:

The user registers or logs in, triggering authentication processes that validate credentials against the Users table.
Document Upload:

User uploads a document via the frontend.
The backend stores it on AWS S3, generates metadata, and saves it in the Documents table.
Document Parsing and Indexing:

Upon upload, parse_content() extracts the text content and indexes it using LangChain/LlamaIndex for efficient query retrieval.
Query Execution:

When a user submits a query, generate_response() retrieves the relevant document content using RAG agents and Elasticsearch.
The response is generated and sent to the frontend for display.
The query and response are stored in the Queries table for future reference.
