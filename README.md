# Full-Stack-Development
# Document Management System with NLP Querying

A secure, scalable, full-stack application for managing documents with advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities. This application enables users to upload, store, and interact with documents of various formats (e.g., PDF, PPT, CSV) and get precise answers to their queries based on the content within.

## Features

- **Document Upload & Management**: Supports PDF, PPT, CSV, and other formats, with secure storage on AWS S3.
- **NLP Querying with RAG Agents**: Leverages RAG (Retrieve and Generate) agents for context-aware responses to user queries.
- **Session-Based User Authentication**: Ensures secure access and data handling.
- **High Scalability & Performance**: Designed to scale with Docker, Kubernetes, Redis caching, and PostgreSQL.
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Optional Prometheus and Grafana monitoring, plus ELK stack for structured logging.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, Redis
- **NLP Processing**: LangChain or LlamaIndex
- **File Storage**: AWS S3
- **Authentication**: Session-based or JWT
- **Search Engine**: Elasticsearch
- **Containerization & Orchestration**: Docker, Kubernetes

## Architecture Overview

The application consists of the following major components:
- **Frontend**: A React.js interface for document upload and querying.
- **Backend**: FastAPI handles document storage, NLP processing, and authentication.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data, Redis for caching.
- **NLP & RAG Agents**: Processes queries and retrieves answers based on indexed documents.
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 for scalable document storage.
