# Full-Stack-Development
The application should support document management, user authentication, and efficient RAG agents, and utilize unstructured.io for efficient parsing of document content.
Develop a secure, scalable, full-stack application that allows users to upload, store, and interact with any type of documents ( pdf, ppt, csv etc. ) through advanced natural language processing (NLP) and implement a RAG Agent to do the querying for any question the user has. The application should support document management, user authentication, and efficient RAG agents, and utilize unstructured.io for efficient parsing of document content.
